# Django Project Setup
    A virtual environment helps isolate your project's dependencies from the global Python environment. Follow the steps below to create a virtual environment for your project:
    python3 -m venv myenv
 # Activate the Virtual Environment
    To start working within the virtual environment, you need to activate it. Follow the steps below to activate the virtual environment:
    myenv\Scripts\activate

# install the modules
    Run the following command to install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Once the installation process finishes, all the project's dependencies will be installed in your virtual environment. You can now proceed with running your Django REST Framework project.
